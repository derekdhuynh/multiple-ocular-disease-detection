# Fundus Image-Based Diagnosis of Multiple Ocular Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Title subject to change.

# TODO Backend
- [X] Inspect the rest of the viable datasets
- [X] See if annotations for validation images sourced from GC can be
  acquired (might just go ahead with what we have)
- [X] Unify the datasets
- [X] Zip and upload unified dataset (able to train on Matthew's GPU/Colab/Derek's faster laptop).
- [X] Develop data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Write data to Colab
- [ ] Find best image size
- [ ] Search for best architecture and hyperparameters, train for a few epochs on the 
  dataset
- [ ] Train final model
- [ ] Evaluate (March 17th)
- [ ] Touch up on plots and overall presentation (March 20th)
