# Fundus Image-Based Diagnosis of Multiple Ocular Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

The following study examines one of the most substantial problems in the medical field, the diagnosis of ocular diseases. According to the WHO, over 2.2 billion people live with a vision impairment. Leading causes of vision complications include conditions such as diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma, and myopia. Unfortunately, many of these ailments only present symptoms at advanced and irreversible stages. Consequently, it is imperative to diagnose these diseases early to prevent long-term health-related burdens. We propose a novel detection system for multiple ocular diseases using a deep convolutional neural network. The model is capable of identifying several diseases from fundus images of the retina, achieving an AUC score of 0.75. This study aims to serve as an effective assistive diagnostic tool for eye-care professionals through the use of a CNN. We believe that our research shows an automated system for eye disease detection is possible for future clinical use.

Our models were trained on an 80/10/10 train/validation/test split, with the training dataset containing 11,020 images and the validation and test set containing 1377 and 1378 images respectively. We chose these splits to maximize the amount of training data available due to the relatively small size of our dataset. The validation set was used to monitor the generalization error while training and to tune the hyperparameters. Of the 7 model architectures and configurations that we tested, the VGG-19 model trained with the stochastic gradient descent optimizer achieved the performance, with an AUC score of 0.75, recall of 0.78,  precision of 0.57 and an F1-score of 0.66 on the test set. These metrics were chosen based on their effectiveness in evaluating the performance of a model on imbalanced datasets, which is the case for this scenario.

# Libraries Used
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* sci-kit learn

# ocularnn Webapp Design
This webapp is made with Flask and is meant as a proof of concept for a
potential virtual solution for ocular disease detection. This would be used by
medical professionals to help diagnose patients with certain ocular diseases

* Frontend (probably use Bootstrap)
    * Doctor login/registration page
    * A prediction page for user upload and viewing their image, display
      some stats about the image (std, mean, size).
        * Maybe two centered flexboxes, one for uploaded and second for 
        preprocessed image
        * Also have the option of randomly selecting an image from the test
        set for evaluation
        * Left and right eyes, allow for only the input of one of them as well
    * A dashboard for the "doctor's" patients
    * A view for each patient describing the model's predicted confidence of 
    each disease being present

* Backend
    * Add user authentication
    * Doctor uploads image sees the preprocessed output, then a prediction is made
    * SQLAlchemy DB
        * Each doctor will have patients which in turn will have data about
        them (ex. Name, age, gender, ID, their image data and their detected
        diseases)
    * Model serving predictions, display response to doctor and store the results
    in the DB
