# Fundus Image-Based Diagnosis of Multiple Ocular Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Title subject to change.
# TODO Backend
* Inspect the rest of the viable datasets
* See if annotations for validation images sourced from GC can be
  acquired (might just go ahead with what we have)
* Unify the datasets
* Zip and upload unified dataset (able to train on Matthew's GPU/Colab/Derek's faster laptop.
* Train prototype architechtures on one of the datasets (G1020 or ODIR or RFMiD) to shortlist viable strategies
* Scale prototype architechture to the unified dataset
* OPT - Evaluate on online judge platforms
